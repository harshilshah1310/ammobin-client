All site statistics are collected from nginx server logs (ie: what your browser sends when it requests a page) and by using url redirection to track clicks to vendors.",

Other times, ammobin-classifer parses other numbers in the title as the item count. Since Ammobin uses automated scraping, it is not possible to manually correct these errors (as much as it would be great to not have to see it)."
